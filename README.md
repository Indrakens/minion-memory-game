# MINION MEMORY GAME
Minion Memory Game is a concentration card game. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. It is a good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well. During the game, it becomes known where certain cards are located, and so upon turning up one card, players with a good memory will be able to remember where they have already seen its pair.

  *  Also, I have an issue with when you lose the game and have one live left, you click on a card but the second card won't open, and straight away shows up alert window. I wasn't able to fix this issue.
